# ZombieGame
simple command game


A zombie managed to get into the living room of your home while you were asleep, so you will need to gather the appropriate supplies to get rid of it. Your task is to obtain the leather jacket from the bedroom to create a bite-proof body suit, a gun from the bedroom closet and the knife from the kitchen, the baseball bat from the basement, a hammer from the garage, and a helmet from the trophy room next to the garage.
